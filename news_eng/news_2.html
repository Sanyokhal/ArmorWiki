        <p>A Ukrainian tanker and YouTube blogger published a video with a detailed review of one of the main battle tanks of the Russian army T-90A, which was captured by Ukrainian servicemen.</p>
        <p>Judging by the condition of some components and elements, the tank was in service with the Russians for a long time without proper maintenance. According to the military, this condition of the combat vehicle may indicate that its last overhaul was at least 15 years ago. And taking into account the fact that this type of armored vehicle began to be manufactured only in 2005, it can be concluded that the car has not been overhauled at all since its manufacture.</p>
        <p>According to the blogger, the machine got to the soldiers of the Armed Forces with a damaged night sight, optical devices and elements of the fire control system due to poor maintenance by the crew. But despite the neglected state and a number of malfunctions, the car is still capable of fighting. Therefore, after repair, he will join the armed forces of Ukraine..</p>

        <p>As the author of the video notes, the experience of using T-90A tanks in the Russian-Ukrainian war showed that a number of design solutions during the development of this machine were unsuccessful on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>The Russian complex of active optical-electronic countermeasures "Curtain-1", a characteristic feature of which is two searchlights on the tower of the tank, which shine with rays in the infrared spectrum, turned out to be ineffective. It was created to combat guided anti-tank missiles, but cannot counter modern ATGMs used by the Armed Forces, including the American FGM-148 Javelin</p>
        <p>T-90 is a deep modernization of the Soviet tank T-72B, created in Nizhny Tagil "UKBTM" in 1989. In 2004-2006, the tank was significantly improved and put into production for the Russian Armed Forces under the index T-90A</p>
        <p>T-90A has a number of important changes. In the 2004 modification, the Buran-M thermal imager serves as a night sight of the combat vehicle. Since 2006, it has been replaced by the more modern thermal imager of the second generation "ЕССА". It has a French Thales “Catherine FC” matrix, stabilized in two planes and integrated with its main rangefinder channel. This made it possible to increase the range of the night vision device from 1,800 to 4,000 m.</p>
        <p>The standard tower of the T-72B model was replaced by a reinforced welded one with a frontal part size of 950 mm, which significantly increased its security. Also, the tank received a new booking scheme with "Kontakt-5" dynamic protection</p>
        <p>Instead of the old 840-horsepower B-84-1 diesel engine, which was installed on the T-72B, the modernized machine received a new 1000-horsepower B-92S2 engine.</p>
        <p>According to official data, as of the beginning of 2012, the total production of the T-90 and its modifications for the Russian Armed Forces amounted to about 500 tanks: about 120 T-90s, 32 T-90A units with the Buran-M night sight, and about 337 combat tanks T-90A machines with the "ЕССА" thermal imager with the "Catherine FC" matrix.</p>
