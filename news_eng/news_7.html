    <h2 id="label">Chronicle of battles of BTR-4MV1 during the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast</h2>
    <h3 id="pub_data">12.11.2022</h3>
    <div class="info">
        <div class="img_cont">
            <img src="../images/btr-4mv1.jpg" alt="">
            <h4 class="date_img">BTR-4MV1</h4>
        </div>
        <p>A one-of-a-kind demonstration sample of the most modern Ukrainian armored personnel carrier BTR-4MV1 takes part in battles in the Kharkiv region.</p>
        <p>BTR-4MV1 was created by specialists of the Kharkiv Design Bureau named after Morozov", which is part of "Ukroboronprom".</p>
        <div class="img_cont">
            <img src="../images/btr-4mv1_m.jpg" alt="">
            <h4 class="date_img">BTR-4MV1</h4>
        </div>
        <p>This armored personnel carrier is a new stage in the development of the experimental BTR-4MV model, which, in turn, became a modernization of the serial Ukrainian BTR-4E, in which the approach to booking the vehicle was seriously revised based on the experience of combat operations in Eastern Ukraine in 2014-2015 years In the process of experimental work, a new armored transporter body was developed. Thus, the BTR-4MV1 received better protection in which the method of modular reservation was implemented.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the BTR-4 in this version was presented at the exhibition "Weapons and Security-2017".</p>
        <p>Visual features of the "four" in the "MV1" version were a characteristic monolithic armor plate installed at an acute angle instead of frontal windows, as in a standard armored personnel carrier, and a new apparel in the stern, which replaced the usual armored doors.</p>
        <p>Despite a much higher level of armor protection and a number of upgrades, the armored personnel carrier had a somewhat archaic undercarriage design, problems with cross-country ability, and layout deficiencies. Because of this, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was not interested in the development.</p>
        <p>However, in February 2021, a photo from the Kharkiv airport appeared online. There they noticed how a car painted in desert camouflage was being loaded onto a plane. KhBKM transported its experimental BTR-4MV1 to the UAE, where the machine was supposed to be at the stand of the Ukrainian delegation in Dubai as part of the IDEX-2021 defense exhibition.</p>
        <p>The first confirmation that the car hit the battlefield appeared in March of this year. Then the armored personnel carriers were spotted in battles on the outskirts of Kharkiv. The equipment was received by the 5th Slobojan Brigade of NSU.</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">Kevlar-Ð•</h4>
        </div>
        <p>And a week earlier, a prototype of the Kevlar-E infantry fighting vehicle was spotted in Kharkiv, which the Kharkiv Transport Equipment Plant handed over to the needs of the Ukrainian army.</p>
        <p>Later, in October, armored personnel carriers were again spotted in Kharkiv Oblast. This time - with green camouflage on top of the factory "desert" and Ukrainian recognition signs.</p>
        <p>The next time the photos of the "four" became publicly available during the so-called Balaklia-Kupian offensive operation, during which the defenses of the Russian troops were breached and approximately 2,500 square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine were liberated.</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">BTR-4MV1 in Kharkiv region</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The armored personnel carrier was spotted after the fighting in the recently liberated Izyum.</p>
        <p>A little later, the car was filmed in the center of Kupyansk during the entry of Ukrainian troops into the city. This APC can be recognized by its distinctive outfit and the painted flag to the left of it.</p>
        <p>In October, the Tysk Telegram channel published a photo of the BTR-4MV1 with the crew and the local population in one of the liberated villages in Kharkiv Oblast.</p>
        <p>Thus, the combat vehicle of the Kharkiv bureau in the first ranks passed the baptism of fire and a difficult combat path from the defense of the semi-encircled city of Kharkiv at the beginning of the year to the liberation of the entire region from the occupation forces.</p>
