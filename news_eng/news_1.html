            <img src="../images/news_f-15.jpg" alt="">
            <h4 class="date_img">F-15 Eagle</h4>
        </div>
        <p>As of 1992, the Air Force of Ukraine had: MiG-23 (80 units), MiG-29 (220 units), Su-27 (40 units), Su-24 (150 units), Tu-16 (30 units), Tu- 22 (30 units), Tu-22M (36 units), Yak-28 (35 units), MiG-25 (15 units), Su-17 (30 units), Su-24 (12 units), 900 rotorcraft of various purposes .
            And why did such a question arise at all, when the "gods of war" gunners are in trend now, and before that the most hyped tool for destroying the enemy was the "Bayraktar TV2" UAV? The answer is known to all military experts - "who controls the air, controls the battlefield"!
            And here nothing has changed since the Second World War, when it was the superiority of the Allies in the air (and not at all the heroism of the Soviet soldier and the number of tanks) that became the key to victory on the battlefield. Similarly, the inability of the enemy's aviation to create complete superiority in the air became the main reason for the failure of the "blitz special operation" of the Rashist troops. Why this happened in my opinion is well explained in this video (in English). Unfortunately, I did not find such an analysis in our mass media, because, most likely, no one would do it.</p>
        <p>So, although the huge progress in the development of UAVs has had a significant impact on the conduct of modern warfare, drones are still unable to perform the entire range of manned aviation tasks. The main limitations of UAVs at this time are the nomenclature of aviation means of destruction (AMV), the limited overview of the battlefield and the need to transmit control information between the UAV and the decision-making center. And if the first is only a matter of time, the second can be solved by improving the sensors on the UAV and the operator's workplace, then the third is a big problem, because it is always easier to arrange obstacles for the communication channel than to ensure its operation, especially with increasing distance.
            Without the use of manned aviation, the defense loses the possibility of an instant reaction to enemy breakthroughs that threaten the environment (boilers), and the liberation of occupied territories can be extended several times and significantly increase the loss of personnel.
            So, sooner or later, the question of arming the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces with a modern NATO aircraft, which should perform most of the functions of the current aircraft fleet, which consists of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters, Su-25 attack aircraft and front-line Su-24 bomber. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages (and compared to NATO equipment - only disadvantages), and although they could be repaired at Ukrainian enterprises, due to the lack of production and inevitable losses during the war, they are already history.</p>

            <img src="../images/news_f-16.jpg" alt="">
            <h4 class="date_img">F-16 Fighting Falcon</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Of course, a multipurpose military aircraft must first of all be able to protect itself and friendly aircraft from enemy aircraft. The primary air-to-air missile for the F-16 (as well as all US aircraft) is the famous AIM-120 AMRAAM. This is just the case when the enemy does not have analogues and is not expected to (please don't need to talk about the long-suffering R-77/RVV-AE, I'm not interested in what was painted for it in TTX).</p>
        <p>Information about the AIM-120 is available, but its main advantages are an active homing head, which is able to independently, without illumination from the carrier aircraft, aim at the target, redirect to the target in case of loss due to anti-missile means, and aim at an obstacle. Thanks to modern electronics, the control system has optimized algorithms for targeting and intercepting the target. In addition, a solid-fuel rocket engine uses low-smoke fuel that does not unmask the rocket in the early stages of flight. The missile itself is quite small for its outstanding characteristics and highly maneuverable. In short, this rocket is any pilot's worst dream.</p>
        <p>In addition to it, there is also an AIM-9 with an infrared homing system, the latest modifications of which are superior to everything that the enemy has (the P-73 is not even close).</p>
        <p>High-precision weapons of the air-to-surface class also meet the most modern requirements. Quite important is the possibility of using anti-radar missiles of the AGM-88 type, which are capable of attacking any air defense system without entering the zone of their damage. Perhaps the most effective guided weapons are missiles of the AGM-65 family, which are capable of hitting any target on the surface and have a huge number of modifications of the GSO and warheads for each case.</p>
        <p>AGM-154 type glider ammunition with a range of over 100 km, GPS guidance and a variety of warheads. AGM-158 cruise missiles with a range "to the target", a complex guidance system capable of overcoming any enemy air defense and hitting a specific letter on the Mausoleum. AGM-84 Harpoons of a huge number of modifications, capable of sinking any ship (proved by the Neptunes), are already known to many.</p>
        <p>About unguided and corrective bombs for F-16 in general, you can write a book in several volumes. In short, these are a huge number of JDAM bombs (by GPS), GBUs with mainly laser guidance (including the most advanced GBU-39 with various guidance methods), and cluster munitions of the CBU type, among which the CBU-97/105 stands out, which are the best means of defeating a cluster of armored vehicles.</p>
        <p>The versatility of the F-16 and its state-of-the-art weaponry will allow in one sortie to perform several tasks of gaining air superiority, suppressing anti-aircraft defenses and attacking enemy ground targets. At the same time, only one type of aircraft can do this much more effectively than all the types currently in service with the Armed Forces, with a much smaller number of aircraft.</p>
        <p>What about the other planes mentioned by the minister? Well, any non-US aircraft will be limited in one way or another by the weapons available to them.</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">A-10 Warthog</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The F-15 is a typical purely fighter (as well as the MiG-29 and Su-27 of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces), which is significantly more effective than the F-16 against air targets, but is not capable of effectively striking ground targets, while the F-15E modification is essentially a different model that is much more complex (in every sense of the word) than the F-16C.</p>
        <p>The A-10 attack aircraft is, of course, the most effective aircraft in the world against ground targets (especially its latest modifications), but it is not capable of effectively countering enemy fighters and intercepting missiles that attack Ukrainian cities. That is, in the complex, the F-15 plus the A-10 will be significantly more effective (and a separate article can be written about this) than the F-16 alone, but this will significantly increase the training time, the complexity of maintenance and the cost of delivery.</p>
