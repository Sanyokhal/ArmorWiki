        </div>
        <p>Ukrainian troops were able to liberate almost the entire Kharkiv region within a week.</p>
        <p>On the afternoon of September 6, the first reports began to appear about the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of the city of Balaklia in Kharkiv Oblast.</p>
        <p>The military chose an equilateral white cross to mark Ukrainian equipment during the counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast.</p>
        <p>Ukrainians were able to take control of such important cities for Russia as Kupyansk and Izyum in just a few days. After all, it was Kupyansk that was an important logistical center through which the occupiers could supply their troops in Izyum, and the Izyum bridgehead was used by the military of the aggressor country to advance to the north of Donetsk region.</p>
        <p>For 7 days it was possible to liberate four cities - Balaklia, Izyum, Kupyansk and Vovchansk. The total area of these de-occupied territories is more than 2,000 square kilometers.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin did not immediately admit its defeat. Only on September 10, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation announced that it had "winded down" and "regrouped" its troops from the Kharkiv region in order to strengthen the Donetsk direction.</p>
        <p>The retreat of the Russians, which the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation called a "regrouping", was chaotic, which led to significant losses in equipment, which was destroyed or reached Ukrainian forces relatively undamaged.</p>
        <p>Ukraine's victory in the operation in the Kharkiv region was achieved in particular thanks to the advantage in quality weapons that Ukraine received from partner countries.</p>
        <p><b>KRAB</b></p>

        </div>
        <p>During the counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian forces deployed their new artillery.</p>
        <p>In particular, 155-mm self-propelled artillery installations "KRAB" of Polish production.</p>
        <p>Ukraine received the first 18 KRAB howitzers as part of military support from Poland in May this year.</p>
        <p>The crew of this machine is 5 soldiers, its weight is about 50 tons. The transition time of the howitzer from the derivative to the combat position is 30 seconds. The electronic systems of the ACS have digital radio communication and thermal imagers, warning systems, self-defense and ground navigation with topographic reference.</p>
        <p>Target correction is carried out using a UAV. The 1,000-horsepower power plant allows you to reach a speed of up to 60 kilometers per hour on an asphalt road and 30 kilometers per hour on a dirt road. The range reaches 400 km.</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">PzH 2000</h4>
        </div>
        <p>In the course of the counteroffensive, German self-propelled artillery installations "Panzerhaubitze 2000" are used.</p>
        <p>Officially, the Ukrainian military received about 18 self-propelled guns "PzH 2000". This is a joint support package from Germany and the Netherlands (10 from Germany and 8 from the Netherlands). Together with the adapted self-propelled guns, the Ukrainian military received spare parts for this equipment and operational training.</p>
        <p>"PzH 2000" is made on the basis of components and units of the "Leopard 2" tank.</p>
        <p>The German self-propelled artillery installation has an automatic charging system and a high level of automation of all systems.</p>
        <p><b>М109</b></p>

        </div>
        <p>M109 self-propelled artillery installations are used during the counteroffensive.</p>
        <p>There is little information about the work of these self-propelled guns. Probably, in the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian military used the M109, which Ukraine received from Latvia last month. These are six self-propelled howitzers in the M109A5 version.</p>
        <p>M109A5 is capable of firing at a distance of 22 km with conventional ammunition and at a distance of 30 km with special ammunition.</p>
        <p>It takes a minute to move from a march to the first howitzer shot, and 30 seconds to leave the position after firing.</p>

        </div>
        <p>During the Kharkiv Oblast counteroffensive, videos of M270 and M142 HIMARS reactive artillery systems began to appear.</p>
        <p>The authors of the video reported that these MLRS were recorded in the Kharkiv region, but the installations did not have identification marks in the form of white crosses.</p>
        <p>It was reported that "M142/M270" worked on Russian positions from the area of liberated Balaklia. "M270" anti-aircraft guns were accompanied by Turkish-made "Kirpi" armored vehicles.</p>
        <p>The United States of America handed Ukraine 16 "M142 HIMARS" installations. Germany delivered three rocket launchers "MARS II" ("M270"), and Britain transferred 6 "M270" installations to Ukraine.</p>

        </div>
        <p>During the counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces used T-72M1 tanks, which were transferred by the countries of the European Union.</p>
        <p>T-72 tanks were transferred to Ukraine by Poland, the Czech Republic and North Macedonia. Poland provided about 200 tanks for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>The T-72M tank is an export version of the Soviet T-72A tank. In 1982, the world saw the M1 model - the further development of the T-72M.</p>
        <p>The tank received an additional 16-mm armor plate on the upper front part of the hull and combined turret armor.</p>

        </div>
        <p>During the counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian forces used FV103 Spartan armored personnel carriers from Great Britain.</p>
        <p>"FV103" belongs to the family of CVR (Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance) armored combat vehicles..</p>
        <p>In the British army, this armored personnel carrier is used to transport small specialized groups of scouts, anti-aircraft gunners, mortarmen, sappers, etc.</p>
        <p>Spartan can carry up to seven people, including three crew members. This armored personnel carrier is armed with one 7.62 mm machine gun.</p>
