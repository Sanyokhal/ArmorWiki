    <h3 id="pub_data">11.11.2022</h3>

            <h4 class="date_img">Firing from C-60</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Russia began arming its mobilized forces with S-60 anti-aircraft guns removed from storage. Rare weapons are deconserved and restored for the newly created military units of the occupying country. This is evidenced by photos and videos that appear on social networks.</p>
        <p>However, this is not the first appearance of 57-mm anti-aircraft artillery on the battlefield during the current Russian-Ukrainian war. Information about the use of S-60s removed from conservation first appeared in May of this year. Then, Ukraine began to return S-60 anti-aircraft artillery systems to the ranks of the Kharkiv Territorial Defense, one of which was installed on the chassis of the KrAZ-6322 army flatbed truck with a 6x6 wheel formula.</p>
        <p><b>S-60: history of creation and key characteristics</b></p>
        <div class="img_cont">
            <img src="../images/s-60.jpg" alt="">
            <h4 class="date_img">ะก-60</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Already in the 60s, with the advent of much faster and more maneuverable aircraft, the fire efficiency of the anti-aircraft artillery complex began to drop rapidly, and the consumption of ammunition increased in some places by 2-3 times. Until the end of the 80s, the last military unit in the ranks of the USSR Armed Forces to use the S-60 was the 990th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment (990th ZaP) of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division during the Afghan War. The anti-aircraft batteries of this regiment provided combat protection for the Kunduz airport.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of the post-Soviet countries, including Ukraine and the Russian Federation, removed the S-60 from their armies due to its moral obsolescence. In Russia, part of the decommissioned guns went for disposal, while others were handed over for conservation and further storage.</p>
        <p><b>S-60 in the Russian-Ukrainian war</b></p>
        <p>The troops of the occupying country failed to capture Ukraine in a few days. The protracted war exhausted the weapons reserves of both countries, which prompted the return from conservation of such frankly archaic weapons as the S-60.</p>
        <p>Although Soviet 57 mm anti-aircraft artillery systems have long been ineffective against combat aircraft, they can still engage attack helicopters. Infantry cannot hit them with small arms: the range of the shot is not enough, and if it is enough, the helicopter has a sufficient level of reservation. Also, as the practice of eight months of war has shown, even units saturated with portable anti-aircraft missile systems cannot be guaranteed to hit targets due to the active use of thermal traps.</p>
        <p>A separate remark about the potential of the S-60 should be added in the context of the appearance on the battlefield of Iranian barrage drones Shahed-131 and Shahed-136. Although the flight speed and dimensions of the fuselage of these UAVs are generally commensurate with the purposes for which the S-60 was developed, this complex can hardly be called a good counter to kamikaze drones for a number of reasons. First, the S-60 installation is designed to work as part of batteries and divisions. And there, the low fire density of one calculation was compensated by the number of these calculations. Secondly, the work of calculation is complicated by the tactics of using shahids. If the drones fly along a given route at heights of 100-200 meters above the ground, this creates a high angular speed and a short time the target stays in the field of view of the calculation. </p>
        <p>In addition to its intended use, the 57 mm artillery gun can also be used for direct fire on manpower and lightly armored vehicles. This practice became widespread in numerous Arab wars due to the powerful S-60 ammunition and relatively high rate of fire. Installing these guns on truck chassis turns them into improvised self-propelled artillery installations with high mobility and quite versatile functionality.</p>
        <p>Having a serious caliber for an automatic gun, the AZP-57 is able to successfully fight light armored vehicles produced by the Warsaw Pact countries, which were widely used in the Far East and during the Russian-Ukrainian war. Also, thanks to a good combination of penetration ability and high-explosive action of ammunition, the installation is able to effectively knock out infantry from urban buildings and simple fortifications by firing at them with direct fire.</p>
        <p>Another method of impressing targets can be the firing of artillery systems from closed positions. This is shooting along a steep parabola using indirect aiming at a target that is out of direct visibility from the firing position. This method reliably covers fire equipment from direct ground observation of the enemy, and therefore protects against return fire.</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">soldiers of the Armed Forces fire from a closed position</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The Ukrainian military uses this tactic of working with the S-60. In the video, the calculation works from a closed position, so the UAV operator helps the military to hit the target. With the help of a drone and a smartphone, the military can adjust fire.</p>
        <p>The use of 57-mm guns from closed positions together with ballistic computers and aerial reconnaissance allows you to extend the range of effective fire to a distance of more than 6 kilometers.</p>
        <p><b>Increasing the effectiveness of the application of the ZAC</b></p>
        <p>More effective use of such artillery on ground targets can be ensured by adding the calculation of the corrector gun with an unmanned aerial vehicle, the use of combat control systems of the tactical link, for example, the Ukrainian "Nettles" or "Armor", currently used by the Armed Forces, modern optics and more advanced gun guidance mechanisms.</p>
        <p>So, in the course of deconservation and repair, some Ukrainian enterprises modernize the S-60 by installing a universal control unit, which is programmed to execute a certain number of commands. Similar systems are widely used in industry and are freely available. Such a control unit controls electric gun guidance drives, which, after entering a command on the control panel, automatically direct the gun to the required angle. Such a system minimizes the reaction time and increases the accuracy of targeting, which in the complex brings the efficiency of the modernized system to a new level.</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">The Ukrainian design of the S-60 uses an optical station and modern guidance mechanisms for direct fire.</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Another method of improving the efficiency of these artillery systems is the use of modern automated unit control systems (ACS). For example, the combat control system of the tactical unit "Nettle", which was tested in real combat conditions and is intended for the automation of certain control tasks at the level of the battalion, company, platoon and individual units of equipment.</p>
        <div class="img_cont">
            <img src="../images/kropiva.jpg" alt="">
            <h4 class="date_img">The operator of the ACS "Kropyva" directs the "sight" to the coordinates selected by the intelligence and receives corrections for the artillery complex.</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Developed back in 2014, the "Kropyva" ACS helps to combine the means of intelligence, control and fire damage of various units of the Armed Forces into a single information field.</p>
        <p>The ACS provides access to an electronic map of the area with a display of its own GPS position and exchange of data with other subscribers of the system, including positions of allied units, coordinates of detected targets and short text messages. "Kropyva" provides interaction and data transfer from UAV intelligence tools.</p>
        <p>To work with the combat system, you only need to know the coordinates of the target and the location of your artillery battery and weather conditions. These data are entered into the tablet with "Nettle" and then the direction of fire and the distance to the target are calculated automatically.</p>
        <p>The general use of the above budget and affordable solutions in a complex gives a second life to outdated systems and makes them suitable for use in modern combined military combat.</p>
