        <p>The Swedish government will soon make a decision on the supply of more modern weapons to Ukraine.</p>
        <p>This was announced by the Minister of Defense of Sweden, Paul Jonson, writes TT.</p>
        <p>"We intend to return as soon as possible with further support to Ukraine - both political, financial and military, which includes the transfer of more modern weapons systems," he said after the meeting of the Council of the European Union on Friday.</p >
        <p>The head of the Swedish Defense Ministry refused to specify which systems are in question. However, we should note that at the end of the summer, Sweden officially agreed to consider providing Ukraine with Archer self-propelled artillery systems and RBS 70 portable anti-aircraft missile systems</p>

            <h4 class="date_img">Archer</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The Minister noted that the Armed Forces of Sweden have prepared a comprehensive document related to training, changes in defense equipment, and this also creates a prerequisite for the expansion of Swedish support related to the training of the Ukrainian military.</p>
        <p>“We will come back with information on this shortly, but it is urgent and of course important so that we can support Ukraine,” Paul Jonson said.</p>
        <p>Sweden currently participates in the training of the Ukrainian military in Great Britain, and the country's government is considering the possibility of continuing this next year as well as contributing to the EU training mission.</p>
        <p>Sweden has reportedly transferred defense equipment to Ukraine as part of seven different military aid packages.</p>
        <p>The sixth package consisted of educational activities. Swedish instructors are currently conducting basic training of Ukrainian military personnel in Great Britain.</p>
        <p>The seventh Swedish military support package consisted of artillery ammunition worth approximately SEK 500 million.</p>
        <p>Sweden has also previously sent, among other things, anti-tank missiles and other anti-tank weapons, mine clearance equipment, machine guns, Robot 17 man-portable short-range anti-ship missile systems, body armor and field rations.</p>
        <p>Another method of impressing targets can be the firing of artillery systems from closed positions. This is shooting along a steep parabola using indirect aiming at a target that is out of direct visibility from the firing position. This method reliably covers fire equipment from direct ground observation of the enemy, and therefore protects against return fire.</p>

        <p>On October 25, the Swedish Armed Forces and the Military Property Administration submitted a report to the government on how Sweden can militarily support Ukraine in the short and long term. The country's new government promised to develop a long-term program of support for Ukraine, both militarily and in the reconstruction of the country. The government's statement says that Sweden will send more modern weapons systems to Ukraine.</p>
